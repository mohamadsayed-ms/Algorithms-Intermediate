/*3. FizzBuzz

Create an algorithm that inserts the numbers from 1 to 135 into an array, while replacing the values that are divisible by 3 with the word "Fizz",
the numbers that are divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz", and the numbers that are divisible with 3 and 5 with the word "FizzBuzz".
Your output should look like [1,2,'Fizz',4,'Buzz',5,'Fizz',7,8,...] */
